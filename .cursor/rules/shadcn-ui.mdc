# shadcn UI Configuration

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements and components.

## Initialization

If shadcn UI is not initialized in the project, use:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

To add a specific shadcn UI component that is not yet installed, use:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

### Examples:
- Button: `npx shadcn@latest add button`
- Card: `npx shadcn@latest add card`
- Dialog: `npx shadcn@latest add dialog`
- Input: `npx shadcn@latest add input`

## Important Notes

- Always use shadcn UI components for UI elements instead of building custom components from scratch
- Check if a component is already installed before attempting to add it
- shadcn UI components are located in the `src/components/ui` directory (after installation)
- The configuration file is [components.json](mdc:components.json)
