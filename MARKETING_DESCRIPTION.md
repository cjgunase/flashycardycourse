## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
FlashyDoc is the AI-powered flashcard app built specifically for medical students who need to master complex clinical concepts efficiently.

## Long Description (Website/App Store)

### Master Medicine with Intelligence, Not Just Repetition

Medical school is overwhelming. Between anatomy, pharmacology, pathology, and clinical skills, you're drowning in information that you absolutely must retain. FlashyDoc is your intelligent study companion designed to help you learn smarter, not harder.

### Why FlashyDoc is Different

**🤖 AI-Powered Learning Assistant**
Stuck on a question? Instead of just revealing the answer, FlashyDoc's AI tutor guides you to the solution step-by-step. Think of it as having a senior resident available 24/7 to help you work through difficult concepts—without giving away the answer too quickly.

**📚 Organized Deck Management**
Create unlimited custom decks for each subject, rotation, or exam. Whether you're preparing for Step 1, shelf exams, or clinical rotations, organize your high-yield facts exactly how you need them.

**✅ Smart Progress Tracking**
Mark cards as "Done" when you've mastered them, and they automatically move to the bottom of your deck. Focus on what you need to learn, not what you already know. Track your review count and progress over time.

**💾 Export and Take Your Knowledge Anywhere**
Download your decks as Markdown files for offline studying. Review on your commute, during downtime in the hospital, or anywhere without internet.

**🎯 Built for Medical Students**
Clean, distraction-free interface designed for intense study sessions. No gimmicks, no gamification—just effective, focused learning for serious medical students.

"Stop forgetting what you studied last week. FlashyDoc uses AI to help you truly understand medicine, not just memorize it. Perfect for med students drowning in Step 1 prep. Try it free! 🩺📚 #MedStudent #MedEd #USMLE"

### LinkedIn Post
Excited to share FlashyDoc - an AI-powered flashcard platform I've been developing specifically for medical students. 

The problem: Traditional flashcard apps test recall but don't help when you're genuinely stuck on a concept.

The solution: FlashyDoc's AI tutor provides step-by-step guidance to help you work through difficult questions, promoting deeper understanding rather than rote memorization.

Perfect for med students preparing for boards, shelf exams, or just trying to survive pre-clinical years.

### Reddit r/medicalschool Post Title
"I built an AI-powered flashcard app that actually teaches you when you're stuck (not just Anki with extra steps)"

**Post Body:**
Hey r/medicalschool,

M3 here. I got frustrated with traditional flashcard apps that just show you the answer when you get something wrong, so I built FlashyDoc.

**What makes it different:**
- When you mark a card as "need further revision," you can click "Get AI Help" and it walks you through the concept step-by-step instead of just revealing the answer
- Cards you've mastered automatically go to the bottom of the deck
- Export decks as markdown for offline studying
- Clean interface without annoying gamification

I made it specifically for med students who need to actually understand pathophys, pharm, etc., not just memorize buzzwords.

Free tier includes 3 decks. Pro is $9.99/mo for unlimited decks + AI features.

Would love feedback from this community!
