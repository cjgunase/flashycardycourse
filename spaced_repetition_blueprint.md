# Spaced-Repetition Flashcard System: Research-Aligned Blueprint

## 1. Core Principles

-   Spacing effect
-   Retrieval practice
-   Desirable difficulties
-   Encoding variability
-   Interleaving
-   Elaboration & dual coding

## 2. Scheduling

-   Increasing intervals
-   Adapt to retrievability
-   Target retention horizon

## 3. Card Design

-   Atomic but non-trivial cards
-   Generative prompts
-   Dual coding on back
-   Chains of reasoning
-   Equation handling

## 4. Session Design

-   Interleaving after basics
-   Tagging & queue rules

## 5. Elaboration & Self-Explanation

-   Explain-why prompts
-   Concept-map hooks

## 6. Neuroscience-Friendly Habits

-   Short, frequent sessions
-   Sleep-aware timing
-   Desirable difficulty controls

## 7. Implementation Checklist

-   Card model
-   Scheduling logic
-   Session builder
-   Card design helpers
-   Metacognitive feedback
